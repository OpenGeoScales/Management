# Short presentation

OpenGeoScales is a collaborative open data platform providing free access to qualified, harmonized and normalized geospatial open data sources and analytics on various scales.
OpenGeoScales adress environmental topics and it aims at providing certified data and accesible knowledge in climate change issues: GHG emissions, energy, natural hazards, pollution, deforastation, waste...

# Why?

- **Environmental issues**: 
Increasing interest in environmental issues --> Need for reliable environmental open data, aggregated indicators and open source analytics reports.
- **Open data & collaborative analytics**:
Increasing open data providers, platforms and portals --> Lack of platforms providing clean and normalized geospatial data with transparent access to implemented treatments
- **City/community scale**:
Increasing interest of local policymakers in climate impacts in city/community scale --> Rare data is provided in small scale

# Goals

Empower citizens, governments, NGOs, academia, companies and investors with reliable open geo-spatial data and open source analytics to address city-level climate change impacts.

**Key concepts:**
- Environmental issues: climate change, natural hazards, air quality, GHG emissions, energy, pollution  
- Openness: open data, open source
- Community: collaborative work, open source community
- Geospatial data
- Geographical scales: country, city, grid
